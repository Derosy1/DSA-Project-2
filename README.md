# Project Overview: Gender Equality & Compensation Analysis for Palmoria Group
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, is facing reputational damage due to reported gender inequality across its three operational regions. To address this, the CEO has engaged an HR Analytics expert to analyze the company's employee data, focusing on gender distribution, performance ratings, salary structures, and compliance with the newly mandated $90,000 minimum wage. The project involves cleaning the dataset, identifying gender disparities by region and department, detecting gender-based pay gaps, visualizing salary bands, and calculating performance-based bonuses. The goal is to generate actionable insights that will help management promote fairness, improve gender equality, ensure regulatory compliance, and restore public trust ahead of planned business expansion.
# Data Source
The primary data source for this project is the internal HR dataset provided by Palmoria Group. This dataset contains employee-level information including:

Employee demographics (e.g., gender, region, department)

Salary details

Performance ratings

Employment status (active or exited)

Additionally, a bonus rule dataset was provided, outlining how annual bonuses should be allocated based on employee performance ratings. These datasets are assumed to be extracted from Palmoria’s internal HR Information System (HRIS), such as SAP SuccessFactors, BambooHR, or a custom enterprise solution.
